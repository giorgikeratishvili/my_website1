I was born and raised in Tbilisi, Georgia. Georgia or as we Georgians call it "Sakartvelo" is a small country located at the intersection of Eastern Europe and Asia. It was used to be part of the Soviet Union, however we gained independence on the 9th of April 1991. Since then, there has been many challanges facing Georgia but slowly the country is developing and I hope that it is going to have a bright future!
