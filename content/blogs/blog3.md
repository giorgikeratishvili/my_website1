I moved to the UK for studying purposes when was 16 and joined Kimbolton School. After succesfully, completing my A-levels, I was lucky enough to secure an offer from Cambridge University to read Economics. Currently, I am pursuing Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School in order to learn more about the world of finance.
